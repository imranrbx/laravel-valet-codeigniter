# A Laravel Valet driver for CodeIgniter 4

Import the CodeIgniterValetDriver.php file into your ~/.valet/Drivers and you'll be ready to go, or just copy and paste this command in your terminal.

```bash
cd ~/.valet/Drivers && { curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imranrbx/laravel-valet-codeigniter/master/CodeIgniterValetDriver.php ; cd - ; }
```

Cheers!
